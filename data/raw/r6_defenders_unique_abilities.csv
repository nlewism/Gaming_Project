,Operator Name,Operator Unique Ability,Unique Ability Description
0,TUBARÃO,ZOTO CANISTER,"Feel the chill of the new Zoto Canister. The Zoto Canister is a throwable device that can slow enemies, freeze devices to pause their deployment and prevent use, and even leave footprints behind if the frozen area is walked on."
1,FENRIR,F-NATT DREAD MINE,"The F-NATT DREAD MINE is a throwable device that sticks to walls, so it can be hidden in places where fear can fester. Fenrir comes equipped with 5 mines and can activate 3 at a time anywhere on the map."
2,SOLIS,SPEC-IO ELECTRO-SENSOR,"The truth comes to light with Solis' SPEC-IO Electro-Sensor, a new gadget detection device for Defense operatives. With the ability to mark and ping opponents' electronic devices, there is nowhere to hide."
3,AZAMI,KIBA BARRIER,"The Kiba Barrier is a modified kunai that sticks to a surface after it's thrown and releases a material that first expands then solidifies, creating a bulletproof barrier to patch up those holes in your defenses."
4,THORN,RAZORBLOOM SHELL,"The Razorbloom Shell sticks to a surface after it's thrown by Thorn. Shortly after detecting a nearby opponent, it automatically propels a set of sharp blades in all directions, delivering lethal damage."
5,THUNDERBIRD,KÓNA STATION,"When deployed on the ground, the Kóna Station acts as a point of safety for injured and downed Operators. All they have to do is approach the device, and the Kóna Station automatically boosts the Operator's HP or offers a revive."
6,ARUNI,SURYA GATE,"Once in place, the gate projects a laser array capable of detecting anyone moving through it. When an intruder is detected, energy output to the laser increases, causing second- and third-degree burns. We spent nearly an hour tossing everything from wads of paper to pieces of fruit through until we found a setting that maximizes damage while limiting energy consumption."
7,MELUSI,BANSHEE SONIC DEFENSE,"The Banshee Sonic Defence is deployable on surfaces, much like Maestro’s Evil Eyes, but they don’t require any manual control. As soon as an opponent walks close enough to it, it will release its scream and slow them. It can be destroyed, but since it’s bulletproof, Attackers will have to dispense some utility or strike it up close."
8,ORYX,REMAH DASH,"The Remah Dash speed allows him to roam efficiently and cover short distances with unprecedented swiftness. It can also be used to knock down opponents and dash through breakable walls, creating a wide opening. Be careful of the cost, though, as he loses health every time the Remah Dash is used for breaching."
9,WAMAI,MAG-NET SYSTEM,"The Mag-NET System is a thrown, adhesive gadget. It sticks to surfaces and waits. Its function is to attract an opponent’s projectile to its position, and then self-destruct to detonate that projectile."
10,GOYO,VOLCÁN CANISTER,"Like the ordinary Deployable Shield, the Volcán Shield provides cover and allows Defenders to block pathways, but Goyo turns up the heat with an attached incendiary bomb. From the front, however, there’s little indication of which it might be. Until someone shoots the bomb to make it explode, the shield continues to be an obstacle for the Attackers."
11,WARDEN,GLANCE SMART GLASSES,"The Glance serves a function that was almost non-existent on the Defending team. With it active, Warden can see through smoke and turn around what could be a low-intel situation.
Activating his Smart Glasses can also prevent Warden from being blinded by flash effects, or cleanse an existing flash blindness, salvaging an otherwise dangerous few seconds.
However, the Glance’s thermal vision only works as long as Warden stays immobile; otherwise, he is affected by smoke the same as everyone else.
The Glance is a triggered effect, which must be restored through a cooldown after use."
12,MOZZIE,PEST LAUNCHER,"Mozzie’s launcher, Pests, are tiny 4-legged bots that can be used to target a single drone, or deployed into an area to prevent access by a drone. When launched, the Pest latches onto the nearest enemy drone and obscures its camera. It then initiates an override sequence to hack the drone and give control to Mozzie. Counter-intelligence is enabled with no risk of a counter hack. Single-use only, Pests self-destruct by dissolving into thin air once their target is in Mozzie’s control."
13,KAID,"""RTILA"" ELECTROCLAW","Kaid’s ""Rtila"" Electroclaw can electrify reinforced walls and hatches, barbed wire, and deployable shields, making it tougher for the enemy to breach the Kasbah and any facility he’s tasked with protecting. He enters the field with two of these throwable gadgets. Once they’ve attached themselves to a surface, they each electrify metallic objects within a 0.75 meter radius."
14,CLASH,CCE SHIELD,"Clash is the first defender with a shield. The CCE Shield is her primary weapon; she can swap to her secondary at any time, but to do so, she needs to put her shield away first. Her bulletproof extendable shield has the ability to slow down opponents by using a high voltage Charged Field Generator (CFG) that emanates directly in front of the shield in a cylindrical shape. Opponents caught in the CFG also sustain low damage over time. Effective use of the shield allows Clash to block entry points, and to prevent or delay a push by the Attackers."
15,MAESTRO,EVIL EYE,"Maestro uses a remote-controlled turret firing high-energy laser beams. Once affixed to the floor or wall, Maestro can remote-surveil and provide overwatch in a location through the swivel-mounted camera. When the camera device breaks open to fire a laser beam the core is exposed to damage. Otherwise, the turret is unaffected by bullets and melee. Lastly, Evil Eye can see through smoke."
16,ALIBI,PRISMA,"Prisma projects holograms identical to Alibi in an idle position. If you shoot or touch the holograms, you’ll be marked and pinged for the next few seconds. If Prisma is deployed outside, a false “Defender Outside” warning is triggered for Attackers. To add an element of surprise, Prisma conceals the identity of any Defender who ventures outside. Any bullet, melee, or explosives damages Prisma, and will shoot through the hologram. Be careful not to stand too close."
17,VIGIL,ERC-7,"Chul Kyung’s quiet lethality in the field allows him to rely on his Electronic Rendering Cloak (ERC-7) to remain undetected.
The ERC-7 uses Diminished Reality technology to remove perceivable stimuli from its direct environment. Vigil carries a prototype in his backpack, which scans surrounding electronic devices and wipes his image from any cameras in view."
18,ELA,GRZMOT MINE,"Inspired by the 1939 anti-tank Polish grenades used by the iconic Cichociemny during WWII, the sticky Grzmot mines can be anchored on surfaces, impairing hearing and causing a dizzying effect.
These concussion mines are triggered upon proximity, affecting anyone within its radius."
19,LESION,GU MINES,"Gu mines were inspired by the sharp punji sticks used during the Vietnam War. Rubbed with toxic plants or feces, the stakes served to slow down enemy troops by causing severe infections in their camp.
Similarly, Gu mines inject a toxin that injure your opponent and limit their speed."
20,MIRA,BLACK MIRROR,"A specialized laminated glass, which when deployed with oxyacetylene can carve out a one-way mirror on any wall.
If the air pressure is disrupted, however, the glass is ejected and creates a daring opening for both defenders and attackers."
21,ECHO,YOKAI,"Equipped with an acoustic hailing device, this signature drone can fire ultrasonic bursts that disorient all targets in a given perimeter. Yokai also transmits a video feed to Echo, who keeps his immediate perimeter secure.
Embrace the power of technology and embody a turret Defender who can both hold up the siege and support roamers."
22,CAVEIRA,SILENT STEP,"""The “Luison” is wrapped in a rock-based mineral fiber to both insulate and soundproof the silencer. This weapon allows Caveira to incapacitate her target discreetly and conduct an interrogation.
The “Luison” is not only formidable to neutralize your opponent while remaining undetected; it also ensures that no one gets away."
23,VALKYRIE,BLACK EYE,"Encased in a tinted silicone ball, coated in micro-suction cups, the quick deploy camera maintains a clear view thanks to the internal gyroscope that dictates the angle of the lens.
The suction cups allow the camera to adhere to any surface, while the gyroscope mounted lens stabilises the camera angle and focus.
The live video feed is available to all operators."
24,FROST,WELCOME MAT,"The rubber mat and concealed metal jaws are bolted in place. When the pressure plate is engaged, two sets of jaws at ankle and shin height deploy, locking the person in place.
Operators who fall onto a Welcome Mat will be able to remove it from their leg by themselves or with the help of a teammate."
25,MUTE,SIGNAL DISRUPTOR,"Collapsible antennas
Device can be planted on floors
Digital display
Activation levers"
26,SMOKE,REMOTE GAS GRENADE,"Detonator
Remote receiver
Double-sided tape allows vertical or horizontal mounting"
27,CASTLE,ARMOR PANEL,"Castle is an anchor and secure Operator, capable of creating defensive strongholds around the objective, controlling the flow of the attackers and slowing down their assault.
Castle's unique ability is to create reinforced barricades using the: UTP1-Universal Tactical Panel."
28,PULSE,CARDIAC SENSOR,"Pulse is a roamer and intel Operator for a defending team. Thanks to his HB-5 Cardiac Sensor, Pulse can track attackers through surfaces, gathering valuable intel on their position."
29,DOC,STIM PISTOL,"Handheld, trigger-operated pistol
1mg dose of epinephrine, in a saline solution
The pistol is powered by a pressurized CO2 canister"
30,ROOK,ARMOR PACK,"Rook is an anchor and buff Operator, capable of providing a boost to the Defenders, giving them a valuable advantage in a firefight."
31,JÄGER,ACTIVE DEFENSE SYSTEM,Jager can help his team create a defensive stronghold before roaming the map to intercept flanking attackers. He is capable of destroying incoming projectiles due to his unique deployable gadget : the Active Defense System or ADS.
32,BANDIT,SHOCK WIRE,"Bandit is a secure, anti-hard breacher and roamer, capable of denying key entry points for the attackers and defending the objective while on the move."
33,TACHANKA,SHUMIKHA LAUNCHER,"Tachanka’s new gadget, the Shumikha Launcher, is perfect for area denial and for covering unfavorable angles. Its heavy incendiary grenades can bounce multiple times, and their fuse timer only starts after the first bounce, giving them a lot of versatility."
34,KAPKAN,ENTRY DENIAL DEVICE,Kapkan is a trap Operator and a deadly addition to a Defending team. Kapkan is equipped with a Entry Denial Device (EDD-MK II). This trap is a packed C4 charge activated when motion is detected. It can be placed on door and window frames -- denying key entry points for attackers.
